# ICS4U - Dodge-Em Game
[TOC]
## Mini Reflection

Name: Alec Tang 

I think my program is a level 4+ because I made sure to do daily commits and completed all of the necessary tasks to meet the requirements. The program runs smoothly without any noticeable bugs.  

The extra features I included in my program are: 

- End screen, which the game switches to after you lose. It also displays your final score on the screen as well. 

- Scoreboard: it increases depending on the value of the blocks merged. Overall score is displayed on the screen and continuously updates as the game is played.
